# DEBATION
#### Video Demo:  TODO
#### Description:
The project I decided to work on is a video streaming app that enables people to talk to each other from all over the globe. 
It includes some useful chatting features, participant list, and admin controls, and other roles. 
To use it, you'll first have to create an account then sign in. Feel free to add things to your profile or bio as that is what you're
greeted with. Then to make meeting rooms to videostream with other accounts, all you have to do is send the invite link to another user.
A person who makes the meeting room automatically has the priviledge of admin rights, but he or she can assign other users to other roles, 
including admin roles.
So with that said, enjoy a new platform to communicate with your friends through livestreaming and chatting!

I built this app with the following technologies, frameworks and libaries: Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB(for database), EJS templates(for templating engine), 
BCRYPT library, JIMP library, Passport library, Peer.js and IO library. I user YARN as my package manager.

The login and register page, I used the BCRYPT library to hash the password before entering it into a database. Passport library for easier usage of the login features.

On the profile page, the profile images are stored in a file in the server, resized thanks to the JIMP library. The path to the image is then saved in the database for 
that user. The bio info that be editted at any time and is stored in the database for later reference.

To start a room, you first located the "Start room" button. A little form will pop out asking you for the name room and a description of the topic, if needed. Once you 
fill it in and press enter, you are taken to a room where you're asked for you audio and camera. Share the link with other logged in users for them to connect to your 
room. On the participant list, you'll see some admin feature  buttons, know to only you including: "Start video", "End video", "Change role". What they do is very clear
from the name. They start a video for the user connected, end the video stream of an already streaming user, or change the role of any body connected. All this is done
with the use of peerjs and io library.
